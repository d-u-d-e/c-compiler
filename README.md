# Project
This project follows the book by N.Sandler "Writing a C compiler".
We will write the boostrapping compiler in Python.
Maybe in the future when the project is sufficiently mature, we will write the same compiler in (a subset of) the C language that the Python compiler is able to understand, allowing it to compile itself.
