# Introduction ðŸ‘‹
This project is based on N. Sandler's book [_Writing a C Compiler_](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html). 

We are implementing the bootstrap compiler in Python. Once the project reaches a sufficient level of maturity, we might rewrite the compiler in a subset of C that the Python-based compiler can understand, enabling it to compile itself.
